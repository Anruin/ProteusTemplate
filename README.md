# **Proteus Template 6.0**

# First release: March 2016 (under the name "SteamVR Template"
# Latest Version 6.0 (under the name "Proteus VR Template")
# Latest release April 23, 2019
What can I do with that, that I cannot do with the "VR Template" in Unreal?
Well, rapidly: It's single or multiplayer (LAN or Oculus Home); It uses Oculus Avatars (or not); It uses voice over IP (VOIP  -- Oculus Home only); full of nice features fully using Oculus functions; compatible Go/Quest/Rift; minimum use of C++ (but still some, since some methods not possible only in blueprints); hey, we were the first to propose a template back in 2016!

FOR NOOBS: This is super simple. Even if you think Visual Studio is the name of a VFX/Hollywood startup somewhere around LA with people working in open spaces and flip-flops, it requires few manipulations to set up; I could add few instructions how-to on demand.
This template consists of virtual reality compatible pawn and settings, ready to drop in your single or multiplayer app. So what you can do is choose the features you want, and build yourself/modify a pawn based on the functionalities you need
